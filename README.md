**Before contributing, please read the following:**

1. By default, you cannot edit the translation sheets. **If you are interested in providing a translation or improving an existing one, please contact me under jonathanzopf@gmail.com so I can give you the permission to edit the translation sheets. Please note that you need to have a Google account for this. Participants have to be at least 16 years old.** Please inform me when you have finished your work. If you want, you can provide me with your real name, so I can add you to the credits of the game.
2. There are two categories of translation files: App-Translation (strings that are found within the application) and Advertisement-Translation (strings concerning app store marketing graphics, descriptions, etc. as well as leaderboards/achievements).
3. **Please note that you should be a native speaker (or at least a very fluent speaker, when it's not your native language)** of the language you are providing a translation for.
4. **Please translate only directly from English to your target language and not from any other language.** For example, if you want to translate the game to Spanish, and somebody has already provided a translation for French, do not translate the game from French but choose the original English version as source, even if you are better in French than you are in English. This is important, because if your would translate the game from a translation rather than the original source, the quality of your translation will worsen.
5. If your language has multiple regional variations, choose the official version used by the goverment and/or spoken by the majority of the population. There might be multiple forms of your language, that are supported by modern operating systems (such as Portugese (from Portugal) or Portugese (from Brazil)). For this case please refer to the list of languages supported by iOS (https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/dev656087953). If the variation is on the list, feel free to add a localized translation for this variation.
6. When you are interested in translating the game into a language/language variation that is not too widespread (generally not part of this list: https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/dev656087953), we have to reject your translation for the moment. We primarely focus on the most widespread languages first in order to reach a larger audience. Thanks for your interest though, and feel free to contribute to any other language.
7. Do not add any string ids (meaning new rows). Only the developer has the permission to do that when the app content is changing. 
8. There might be new strings needed to be translated with every new app update due to changing app content. **Please check regularly to see if any new strings were added.**
9. **Pay attention to correct spelling and grammer.** If you are unsure about the correct spelling of a word, please look it up on the internet or a dictionary. Use only formal language. Use abreviations only when absolutely needed. If your language has two forms for adressing the user (such as du - Sie (in German) or tu - vous (in French)) you may use the informal one if it suits the context.
10. You may only delete content that is yours. **If you are found to knowingly delete content of other contributors or using profanity in your translations or any other serious misbehavior you will be excluded from participation.** Correcting wrong spelling / incorrect grammar of other users is not considered deleting content.

Thanks you for your help.
